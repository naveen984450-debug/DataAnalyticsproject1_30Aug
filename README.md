This is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard using the Employees dataset.
The data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query with steps like
handling nulls, datatype changes, merging columns, creating parameters,
and adding custom/conditional columns. In the report view, I developed
interactive visuals with slicers, trend line forecasts, and navigation using
bookmarks. I also implemented 20+ complex DAX measures and a few
calculated columns to drive insights. The final dashboard delivers clean,
interactive, and predictive analytics for decision-making.
